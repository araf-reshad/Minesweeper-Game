Goal: Create a classic rendition of the game “Minesweeper” which is a logic puzzle video game genre. The game features a grid of clickable cells, with hidden bombs scattered randomly throughout it. The player's objective is to clear the board without detonating any bombs. This is done with the help of clues that state the number of bombs that exist in each neighboring cell.

Looking towards having the program print the layout of where the bombs are in the console and test each square for what it is. This will also test the bomb pop-up and the win pop-up. Since it is all randomized I would have it restart multiple times to see if it works.

Implementing the Agile Software Development Cycle, the first release is meant to be the simplest version, and each subsequent release is meant to incrementally improve on the previous release. The first release of this project is going to be broken into two parts to force me to slow down and actually work through the stages.

Looked to satisfy these criteria during the construction of the game:

Ability to design a visually appealing game using Pygame or Tkinter with an easy-to-use interface.
Ability to create an error/bug-free game that engages the user.
Ability to use appropriate data types and data structures (ex. lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, etc).
Ability to use existing subprograms (methods and functions), especially when it involves data structures.
Ability to use control structures (ex. loops, conditionals) appropriately and efficiently in simple algorithms
Ability to use modular programming concepts and principles (ex. functions, classes, objects)
Ability to apply and use proper documentation and code maintenance techniques (ex. comments, spacing and naming, docstrings conventions).
